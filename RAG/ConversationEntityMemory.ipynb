        "#### ConversationEntityMemory is a memory class provided by LangChain, designed to track and store information about entities that arise in a conversation. It allows the AI to \"remember\" key facts about people, places, or concepts mentioned during a conversation, so it can refer back to them later on, improving the conversational experience.\n",

        "**Entity Tracking:** It identifies entities (e.g., names, places, concepts) and stores relevant information about them. For instance, if you mention \"Tanmay\" in one part of a conversation, it can remember details about \"Tanmay\" for later reference.\n",

        "**Context-Aware:** It helps the AI maintain context by remembering details about the entities mentioned during the chat, ensuring more natural, fluid conversations over time.\n",

        "**Customization:** You can customize what to store and how to retrieve it during future interactions."

        "- Queried memory using `load_memory_variables` to retrieve relevant entity information for follow-up questions.\n",
        "- Used the built-in `ENTITY_MEMORY_CONVERSATION_TEMPLATE` within a `ConversationChain` to automatically extract and update entity summaries.\n",
