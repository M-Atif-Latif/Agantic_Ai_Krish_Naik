        "7. Prompt Engineering: System + dynamic messages via `ChatPromptTemplate`.\n",
        "8. Token Management: Trimming strategy keeps recent context inside a token budget for efficiency.\n",
        "9. Chained Runnables: Composition of trimming -> prompt -> model -> memory for cleaner orchestration.\n",

        "Security & Best Practices:\n",
        "- Secrets are NEVER hardcoded. Replace `Write your own password` locally with environment variables.\n",
