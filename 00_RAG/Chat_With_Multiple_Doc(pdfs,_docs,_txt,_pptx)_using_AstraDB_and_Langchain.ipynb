        "\n",
        "A professional, open‑source friendly notebook demonstrating how to build a Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow over multiple document types (PDF, TXT, PPTX, DOC) using:\n",
        "\n",
        "- LangChain for orchestration (loading, splitting, chaining)\n",
        "- OpenAI embeddings (can be swapped for any embedding model)\n",
        "- AstraDB (DataStax) as a managed vector store\n",
        "- Unstructured & PyPDF loaders for robust document parsing\n",
        "\n",
        "## What This Notebook Covers\n",
        "1. Environment & dependency setup\n",
        "2. Secure API key handling (placeholders only – add your own locally)\n",
        "3. Loading single & multiple PDFs (Unstructured + PyPDF)\n",
        "4. Chunking text for vectorization\n",
        "5. Initializing embeddings & AstraDB vector store\n",
        "6. Creating a retriever and RAG chain with a prompt template\n",
        "7. Running a sample philosophical Q&A query\n",
        "\n",
        "## How To Use\n",
        "1. Install dependencies (first code cells)\n",
        "2. Replace all placeholder strings \"Write your own password\" with your actual keys/tokens (NEVER commit real secrets)\n",
        "3. Place your documents in the configured folder path\n",
        "4. Run cells sequentially to build the vector store & query it\n",
        "\n",
        "## Security & Open Source Notes\n",
        "- No real credentials are stored here\n",
        "- Use environment variables or secret managers in production\n",
        "- You can swap OpenAI for other providers by changing the embedding & Chat model imports\n",

You ingest PDFs (and easily extensible to DOC/TXT/PPTX), preprocess them with Unstructured + PyPDF loaders, chunk them with a recursive splitter, embed with OpenAI (pluggable), and store vectors in AstraDB for scalable semantic retrieval. A LangChain retrieval chain then fuses relevant chunks with a concise, instruction‑driven prompt to answer user questions grounded strictly in the provided context.\n",
